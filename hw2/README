1) Directions for compiling the code: 

"make" in the respective directories compiles the pthreads and MPI executables
	- pthreads_ocean
        - mpi_ocean

2) Directions for running the code: 

Pthreads:
The program takes 4 arguments: xdim, ydim, number of timesteps, and number of threads. It can be run as below:
 	./pthreads_ocean <xdim> <ydim> <timesteps> <num of threads>

MPI:
The program takes 3 arguments: xdim, ydim, number of timesteps. This needs to be run with mpiexec as shown below:
        mpiexec -n <no. of cores> ./mpi_ocean <xdim> <ydim> <timesteps>
